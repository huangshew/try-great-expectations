## get_started

Notes
1. If you were to connect to a database that requires connection credentials, those would be stored in `great_expectations/uncommitted/config_variables.yml`.
2. You can also configure Great Expectations to store Expectations to other locations, such as S3, Postgres, etc. 
3. Once youâ€™ve configured and saved a Checkpoint, you can load and run it every time you want to validate your data.
